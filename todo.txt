1. Verify if we can run dbServer, dbClient and a thread that invokes dbClient to make request to dbServer periodically -
 in a single RM process - DONE
2. Understand how we can dynamically join a raft cluster -
    A. like increase size from 3 to 4 to 5 without changing config
    B. Node ips is fixed for cluster, we are okay without join-cluster-api
3. How to increase the term period, so that election doesn't happen too much ?
4. Verify if we can tell Ratis that this server is leader now ? - TODO
5. We use zk for leader election and store shared config - this uses extra machines or do they run in same node ?
6. If we use Ratis along with zk then, both might choose different leaders for their clusters - which is bad, bad thing.
7. In current architecture of 2 nodes (primary & secondary) - writes are accepted even if one of the node goes down
BUT
if we use ratis cluster of 3 nodes, if one node goes down, then writes won't be accepted (maybe some config) into
dbServer, unless another node joins in.
8. It means dbClient should try to async upload to dbServer with periodic retries and it should keep track of
whatever stuff it has synced with dbServer ? - which defeats the purpose of dbServer itself ?
9. How does the dbClient know from where it has to continue syncing with dbServer after establishing quorum.
